This is not intented to be an online standalone game. You need a copy of the game to play it. My goal is to program an AI that plays as one of the non-player factions so you don't have to go through the bot flowchart yourself.

The AI is complex because of the asymetric nature of the game, which means that all the factions have different abilities, actions and rules. Also victory conditions depend on the faction.

Logic is not hardcoded but is being developed using machine learning techniques that will help the AI to learn and improve as it gets information from every new game played.
